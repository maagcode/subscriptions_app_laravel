# Laravel Subscrition Based Application

Hello everyone, this is a 'Subscription Based application' built on Laravel 5.2, using its already built-in user authentication.

My main reason to create this was to force myself to dig onto the 'Laravel Cashier' documentation, and be able to applied in production applications.

I used Braintree (Stripe is a little more easier) to add the 'Paypal' payment method (which I use a lot).

## Tools and Documentation used to create the app.

Building this little app was great, simply because it made me do quite some research and there was quite some good hours of learning involved. Here I offer the list of the tools used, as well as all the resources I used to pull it all together.

Braintree Gateway:
    The Gateway method used on the app is Braintree, which allow us the use of Paypal payment as well. For more information visit their Official site (https://www.braintreegateway.com)

Braintree API Documentation:
    Everything you need to know about Braintree is right here. (https://developers.braintreepayments.com/)
    For a more direct access to the Javascript Drop-in Payment UI follow this link. (https://developers.braintreepayments.com/guides/drop-in/javascript/v2)

Laravel Documentation:
    There is nothing like the original documentation to learn how to work with Laravel. It can be a little daunting at first but I promise you is amazing once you get your hands in it. (https://laravel.com/docs/5.2)

Laravel Billing/Cashier:
    This is the core documentation in which I based my App. Everything you need is here, and even if you think is not, believe me, it is right in front of you, you just need to read slow and patienly to find what you are looking for.

    I also recommend (as I did) spending some time reading and understanding some of the Cashier code in order to make your coding experience a little more easier. (https://laravel.com/docs/5.2/billing)

Sequel Pro:
    I am used to work on MySql quite a lot, and Sequel Pro is my favorite tool to handle my databases (only available for MAC). Give it a try. (http://www.sequelpro.com/)


## More to come...

I will from time to time come back and try to make the App more 'front-end' friendly, as well as adding so other features that comes to mind, making it more usable for everybody.

I will be also adding detailed comments throughout all the code lines that need some deeper explanation for ease of understanding.

## App use

This app was built with learning purposes, and as off right now it is fully functional and tested.

If you are in need of a Subscription based template for your app, please feel free to clone it and adjust it to your liking and needs.

Happy Coding!!!!
